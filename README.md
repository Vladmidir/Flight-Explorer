# Flight Explorer

The purpose of this project is to help people visualize data about flights. The motivation of the project is to make an easy-to-use visual interface that allows users to graph live and historical flight routes on a map. For example to graph all flights over a certain period to visually explore any patterns or to search flights by their arrival times, departure times, or flight dates. The project may further be improved to provide comprehensive data regarding flight aircraft and airports.
